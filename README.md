Most patients have families that are providing some level of care and support. In the case of older adults and people with chronic disabilities of all ages, this “informal care” can be substantial in scope, intensity, and duration. Family caregiving raises safety issues in two ways that should concern nurses in all settings. First, caregivers are sometimes referred to as “secondary patients, ” who need and deserve protection and guidance. Research supporting this caregiver-as-client perspective focuses on ways to protect family caregivers’ health and safety because their caregiving demands place them at high risk for injury and adverse events. Second, family caregivers are unpaid providers who often need help to learn how to become competent, safe volunteer workers who can better protect their family members (i.e., the care recipients) from harm.

The elderly constitute the age group most susceptible to wound healing disorders and chronic wounds, the most prevalent being venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers and this imposes substantial morbidity and mortality on millions of the elderly. The effect of wound therapies on universal outcomes includes functional status, pain, physical impairment, mobility, and cognitive impairment, as opposed to wound-specific outcomes.

Although wound care technologies are improving, the number of cases of infected non-healing wounds that have led to below the knee amputation hindering mobility is on the rise throughout the world. It is difficult for the people in this age group to take care of themselves and to go for regular hospital checkups.

E-bandage has the capability to monitor the wound healing process by assessing the wound environment that presents very different characteristics at different stages of healing. This would reduce the need to remove bandages and potentially disturb the wound. Additionally, it could also help create a more efficient hospital environment as caregivers can reduce the time spent on treating individual patients.
